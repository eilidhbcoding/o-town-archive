<p>O-Town Showdown was a phenomenal weekend of competitions in Ottawa focusing on great social dance skills, awesome attitude, creativity, and fun! Running annually from 2013 to 2020, O-Town ran its last Showdown in March of 2024. This site serves to preserve the results of events past and provide access to related information.</p>
<p>Some of O-Town&#39;s former organizers have gone on to form Jazz Dance Junction, a new organization that aims to promote Lindy Hop and Vernacular Jazz in Ottawa through outreach, events, and community partnerships.
