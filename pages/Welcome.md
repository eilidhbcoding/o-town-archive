O-Town Showdown was a phenomenal weekend of competitions in Ottawa focusing on great social dance skills, awesome attitude, creativity, and fun! Running annually from 2013 to 2020, O-Town ran itâ€™s last Showdown in March of 2024. This site serves to preserve the results of events past and provide access to related information.


Some of O-Towns former organizers have gone on to form Jazz Dance Junction, a new organization that aims to promote Lindy Hop and Vernacular Jazz in Ottawa through outreach, events, and community partnerships. Follow what Jazz Dance Junction is up to on social media at [@jazzdancejunction](https://www.instagram.com/jazzdancejunction/) or [JazzDanceJunction.com](http://jazzdancejunction.com).
